# Aishwareeya's Java Projects

Thanks for taking the time to checkout this repository containing several Java (JDK 1.8)
projects that I've been working on. 

Disclaimer: Many of these may still be works in progress.

Here's a list of the projects and ideas I've had so far:

- JCalculator: A simple rite-of-passage Java Calcuator project showcasing some best practices like interfaces, generics, OOD, etc.
- Rifklogger: A generic logging idea I had implemented as an interface for use in your classes.


Thanks!
